/**
 * TODO: define your own async function that uses Axios with a .then() & .catch() block
 * - it should at minimum take a function parameter
 * - inside your then block, try console.log(res.data) to see what is printed when your axios call succeeds
 * - from there, decide what part of res.data to pass to your function parameter (in this case, I passed the entire thing!)
 * - I also deleted my custom CSS from the index.css file so feel free to have fun & play around with the look of your app!
